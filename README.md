# BCrypt.Net-Core
A .net Core port of BCrypt.net

If you're working on a .net core application and need to use BCrypt to store passwords, this is a quick and dirty port of BCrypt.net.
I have not tested using this on the full .net framework yet, only .net Core. It builds, compiles and the Unit tests pass. 

# Disclaimer
I did not write this library, I merely ported it to .net core. All credit goes to Ryan D. Emerle for porting BCrypt to .net in the first place.

## Another Disclaimer
I have never published a nuget package before, so if you see weird and wonderful things happening to the repository, it's probably me trying to get MyGet to work.
